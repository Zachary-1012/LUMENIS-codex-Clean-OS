> Long-term engineering log. Record facts, decisions, tests and unresolved risks; do not write speculative completion claims.

## 2026-08-30

### Governance
- Confirmed ChatGPT main development window as architecture/review/decision coordinator.
- Confirmed other chat windows as auxiliary research windows whose useful conclusions must be consolidated here or in GitHub.
- Confirmed GitHub as the durable project knowledge and handoff layer.

### AI architecture
- Production direction is Ollama-first / external-cloud-AI-optional.
- Core business loop must remain functional without any external AI API key.
- AI Shadow Mode is required before replacing system-native judgments.

### Research layer
- Added integrated Web/GitHub/browser research guidance.
- Public crawler/anti-bot research is allowed for engineering understanding; bypassing CAPTCHA, access controls or platform security is not a project objective.

### Auth / crawler direction
- Cookie/session expiration must be handled by a global in-system auth state and modal rather than an unconditional redirect.
- Modal should expose platform/account/status/reason, and the normal QR/login/verification entry when legitimately available, plus pause/defer/recovery actions.
- Platform risk must never become a silent zero-data result.

### Next audit targets
- Verify current repository contents against PROJECT_STATUS.md.
- Verify AI/Ollama call chain and Shadow Mode implementation.
- Verify Auth modal integration across all platform collectors.
- Verify database migrations and data isolation for the two product releases.
- Verify test coverage and startup paths.
