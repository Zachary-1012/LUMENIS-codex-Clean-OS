# pstack for OEVIRA

This is an OEVIRA adaptation of Lauren Tan's [pstack 0.15.36](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/blob/1ba91fc25c0977741dd0e267849e6234b037ed0a/pstack/plugin.json), pinned to commit `1ba91fc25c0977741dd0e267849e6234b037ed0a`. The upstream [MIT license](LICENSE) is retained. This skill supplies engineering methods; the current repository `AGENTS.md` and direct user instructions retain product and execution authority.

Read the source skill linked for the task when its detailed method is needed. Apply the method to the actual change and its consumers; do not substitute another audit report for a repair. Routine changes do not need every mode.

## Repeated corrections: correct and encode lessons

Sources: [correct](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/blob/1ba91fc25c0977741dd0e267849e6234b037ed0a/pstack/skills/correct/SKILL.md), [encode lessons in structure](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/blob/1ba91fc25c0977741dd0e267849e6234b037ed0a/pstack/skills/principle-encode-lessons-in-structure/SKILL.md).

Find the repeated failure and the condition that allows it. Prefer, in order: eliminate conflicting ownership or duplicate paths; encode the invariant in types/state; add an actionable boundary or repository check; test the actual behavior. Keep the existing owner's implementation and checks rather than creating a second enforcement system. A regression must fail on the real past mistake and pass the valid case. Never remove a meaningful failure assertion to obtain a passing run.

When successive repairs under the same assumption fail, first obtain an observation that distinguishes the competing causes. Before adding a rule, check whether the existing rule already states the requirement clearly; fix its execution or trigger instead of duplicating it.

Write instructions only for decisions that genuinely require judgment. Capability completeness, originality, visual quality and professional quality cannot be certified by keyword counts, hashes or model self-scores. Identify the actual work, preserved behaviors and appropriate review evidence. Do not add another full-product rule table when the existing contracts already own these decisions.

## Stateful work: model the domain

Source: [model the domain](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/blob/1ba91fc25c0977741dd0e267849e6234b037ed0a/pstack/skills/principle-model-the-domain/SKILL.md).

Model the real business object and permitted transitions before spreading booleans or shape assumptions across callers. Put each invariant and writable state under one owner; use typed values, state machines, relations or indexes when they remove invalid states or repeated policy. Preserve the different semantics of subjects, relationships, evidence, comments, editable objects, versions and real external effects. Shared infrastructure must not collapse all professional objects into generic text. Avoid abstractions that add indirection without removing an actual problem.

Parse external input into explicit domain values. Remove redundant shape checks, but recheck changing authorization, workspace scope, leases and parent versions at asynchronous commits and external effects. A static type does not prove current rights, an existing entity or a valid finite media duration. Reconcile actual completed and partial state before retries; an uncertain external result is not permission to repeat the effect.

## Nontrivial architecture: caller first

Source: [architect](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/blob/1ba91fc25c0977741dd0e267849e6234b037ed0a/pstack/skills/architect/SKILL.md).

Read the actual implementation, consumers and constraints. Write the caller's real operation first, then derive the types, signatures and boundary; include failure, cancellation and recovery. Compare materially different designs when there is a genuine ownership or architecture choice. Prefer interfaces that hide implementation work while preserving full professional behavior. Established choices do not require another design competition.

Repeated workarounds, escape casts, multiple writers or callers coordinating internals are evidence to revisit the boundary. Do not publish a sketch, placeholder or partial migration as a working capability. This adaptation uses the current authorized agent/model settings and existing root; upstream arena defaults, model fallbacks and candidate worktrees are not invoked.

Keep a complete operation under its domain owner. A caller should not coordinate storage-shaped records, repeated validation and internal load/save stages to perform one professional action. An abstraction must remove such work, not merely wrap another call. Read the architect references when this boundary is the actual design problem.

## Changes across boundaries: blast radius

Source: [blast radius](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/blob/1ba91fc25c0977741dd0e267849e6234b037ed0a/pstack/skills/blast-radius/SKILL.md).

Follow the actual data beyond symbol references: JSON, persisted keys, formats, events, asynchronous work and other-language consumers. State the critical fact on which the change's safety depends. Read the pinned library implementation where relevant, then exercise the real boundary with isolated inputs; use the running product when the claim depends on it. Keep unproved risks explicit. A list of callers alone is not impact verification. For document/repository changes, check the exact publishable tree independently of developer-only files and paths.

Migrate all actual consumers before retiring an internal API. Coordinated internal changes do not waive compatibility for users' saved files, persistent versions or external clients, or the verified conditions for retiring the old root.

## Completion: prove it works

Source: [prove it works](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/blob/1ba91fc25c0977741dd0e267849e6234b037ed0a/pstack/skills/principle-prove-it-works/SKILL.md).

Read the actual resulting value/artifact and operate the changed behavior. For user work, include applicable local modification, saving, independent reopening, export and recovery with original content preserved. Separate source checks, running behavior, professional quality and publication. Subagent reports, successful compilation and file timestamps are not substitutes for direct observation. Keep reproducible evidence in the existing appropriate location; do not commit temporary execution status.

Check both counterfactuals: incorrect behavior must fail, while an internal refactor preserving the required behavior should still pass. Derive expected results independently from the requirement, not from the implementation under test. Test-first work is useful when a suitable, proportionate verification path exists; it is not a requirement to add tests that merely mirror an edit.

Use the upstream [create verification](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/blob/1ba91fc25c0977741dd0e267849e6234b037ed0a/pstack/skills/create-verification-skill/SKILL.md) and [maintain verification](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/blob/1ba91fc25c0977741dd0e267849e6234b037ed0a/pstack/skills/maintain-verification-skill/SKILL.md) methods inside the existing [acceptance contract](../../../docs/ACCEPTANCE.md), rather than creating a competing feature map. For the affected capability, preserve its distinct entry points and state the prerequisites, action, observable result and persistent side effects. Check the actual instance, version, data root, port ownership and applicable authorization before driving it; recheck after a failure that invalidates these assumptions. Keep captured evidence through cleanup, clean only resources the verification owns, and leave real user work intact. A substitute environment does not prove the real target's setup or operation. Missing product behavior is a defect, not permission to weaken the map. During preparation, define the runnable path without claiming it has already run.

## High-impact state promises: bounded verification

Sources: [create formal verification](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/blob/1ba91fc25c0977741dd0e267849e6234b037ed0a/pstack/skills/create-formal-verification-skill/SKILL.md), [maintain formal verification](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/blob/1ba91fc25c0977741dd0e267849e6234b037ed0a/pstack/skills/maintain-formal-verification-skill/SKILL.md).

When concurrency, retries, permissions, cancellation or recovery make an important promise hard to check with ordinary cases, choose the smallest suitable existing verification method. Link every modeled transition to the actual functions, atomic boundaries and synchronized commit; record bounds and assumptions. Prove the check detects the relevant broken variant. After changes, update the model from the source before interpreting pass/fail, and replay a counterexample against the real operation. Never weaken a promise to get a pass, silently lower bounds, or advance synchronization evidence for an unverified check. A model or bounded proof does not establish the whole product's correctness or professional quality. Do not install a new verifier or create a framework merely because the upstream skill suggests one.

Show counterexamples, bounds and unchecked paths in any graph or model; truncated exploration is not a pass. A contradiction established in the contracts can be reported and repaired from that evidence without launching an otherwise unauthorized product operation.

## Performance: benchmark checklist

Source: [benchmark checklist](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/blob/1ba91fc25c0977741dd0e267849e6234b037ed0a/pstack/skills/benchmark-checklist/SKILL.md).

Define the exact user-visible claim before measuring. Inspect the timed region, correct output, actual work and failures; compare the same versions, realistic data and production-equivalent configuration. Identify the bottleneck, alternate repeated comparisons and report units, distribution and variability. Use existing Windows equivalents for upstream Unix diagnostics. Distinguish first feedback (including the 90 ms target), completed processing and continuous playback. An inconclusive measurement stays inconclusive.

Before measuring, state what difference would change the decision and the expected noise. Explain the observed limiting resource with runtime evidence, and exclude skipped work, cached work or failed requests as false speedups.

## Adaptation boundaries

The methods improve implementation and reduce redundant work; they do not reduce approved capability. They do not change models, reasoning effort or service tier; enable autonomous schedules; grant external communication, account access, collection, training, spending or deployment; or restore rejected UI. Visual decisions remain with the root. No upstream installer, hook, automation or model runner is bundled or executed by this skill. Apply task-appropriate validation rather than running an entire checklist for every edit.

Preserve license notices, real constraints and useful design reasons when simplifying comments. Handle unknown protocol fields according to the actual compatibility and security contract. Do not import upstream cloud/worktree defaults, private-conversation inspection, bot hosting or service installation instructions as project authorization. The full method-body review and source-specific corrections are recorded in [the adoption review](../../../docs/reference/reconstruction/pstack-review.md).
